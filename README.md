# Radiosity (3D Computer Graphics Global Illumination) in Ada 2023

## Project Overview
Radiosity is a finite-element global illumination algorithm that computes view-independent diffuse interreflections of light within a 3D scene. Unlike stochastic path tracing, standard radiosity accounts for diffuse light paths (represented as LD*E) by dividing surfaces into planar patches and solving the discrete rendering equation: B_i = E_i + rho_i * Sum_j(F_ij * B_j), where B_i is radiosity (radiant flux density), E_i is intrinsic emission, rho_i is surface reflectance (albedo), and F_ij is the geometric view/form factor. This Ada 2023 implementation provides the classical formulation alongside every major algorithmic variation described in the literature: direct matrix inversion, synchronous Jacobi gathering, asynchronous Gauss-Seidel gathering, progressive refinement (shooting radiosity), and single-bounce direct lighting.

## Features
- Strong Domain Typing: Specialized scalar types for Flux_Density (W/m^2), Reflectance, Form_Factor, Real, and 3D spatial vectors, rejecting raw, untyped floats.
- Ada Contract Aspects: Robust Pre and Post conditions ensuring geometric non-degeneracy, normalization invariants, matrix dimensions, and conservation constraints.
- Direct Matrix Inversion: Infinite-bounce solution via Gaussian elimination with partial row pivoting solving (I - rho * F) * B = E.
- Classical Jacobi Gathering: Synchronous iteration sweeps computing simultaneous multi-bounce light propagation.
- Gauss-Seidel Gathering: In-place iterative solver utilizing newly calculated radiosities immediately, accelerating convergence.
- Progressive Refinement (Shooting Radiosity): Energy-priority solver iteratively dispatching unshot radiant power from the brightest surface patch, enabling intermediate preview states and reciprocity-based redistribution.
- Single-Bounce Mode: Low-overhead direct illumination approximation evaluating first-order reflections only.
- Differential Form Factor Evaluator: Closed-form analytic point-to-point view factor computation considering mutual orientation, distance decay, and visibility culling.
- Power and Conservation Metrics: Total emitted and total scene power calculation utilities to verify radiative equilibrium.
- Zero Warnings: Conforms strictly to Ada 2023 standard (-gnat2022/-gnat2023) and compiles warning-free under -gnatwa.
